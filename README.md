I learned postgres using docker by this way. I mean hard way!!! funny though some people might be thinking  the same So, I thought to write it. 
But let me tell you during that course of learning, I also learned that there are other ways. like create dockr files 
and copy these files instead one by one. 

Perhaps using coping files one by one, gave me  learning capability of how to use `copy` command. 

Anyway, I will post another day using docker files to execute all this. 

Happy reading.
