I learned postgres using docker by this way. I mean hard way!!! funny though some people might be thinking  the same.
So, I thought to write about it. But let me tell you during that course of learning, I also learned that there are other ways too. 
like create docker files and copy these files in one go instead one by one. 

Order of reading: 

* Install-PostgreSQL
* Load-PostgreSQL-DB

Perhaps using coping files one by one, gave me  learning capability of how to use `copy` command. 

Anyway, I will post another day using docker files to execute all this. 

Happy reading.
